0x1E. C - Search Algorithms
Description
This repository contains C programs that implement various search algorithms. The goal of these programs is to search for a specific value within an array of integers using different search algorithms such as Linear Search and Binary Search. Additionally, the repository includes files that analyze the time and space complexities of these search algorithms.

Learning Objectives
After completing this project, you should be able to:

Explain what a search algorithm is.
Describe the principles behind Linear Search and Binary Search algorithms.
Understand the best search algorithm to use based on specific needs.
Analyze the time and space complexities of different search algorithms.
